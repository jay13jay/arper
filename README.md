# arper

### Purpose
It's really simple to use, easily extensible,
but more importantly easy to copy and paste if remote retrieval of programs
is impractical.

Also another benefit is python is rather ubiquitous at this point
so the code should run on a very large portion of machines with minimal 
footprint or red flags. 

### To run
open vars file and enter the target and gateway IP, then run the script <br>
Probably going to want to put it in a screen or background it. <br>
~~~~
$ python arper.py 
or, to background:
$ python arper.py &
